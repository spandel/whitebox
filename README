ABOUT WHITEBOX

Whitebox is a highly customizable javascript lightbox made as a jQuery plugin.
It is build upon the thought that no one who uses it should have to know any javascript.
It is customized by inserting data-attributes int to the img-tag in the html, and by making your own themes in css.

Obviously it is also open-source and totally free to use.
